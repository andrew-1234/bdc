### Overview

Handle biodiversity data from several different sources is not an easy
task. Here, we present the Biodiversity Data Cleaning (bdc), an R
package to address quality issues and improve the fitness-for-use of a
dataset. *bdc* contains functions to harmonize and integrate data from
different sources following common standards and protocols and
implements various tests and tools to flag, document, clean, and correct
taxonomic, spatial, and temporal data.

The *bdc* package is organized in thematic modules related to different
biodiversity dimensions, including:

1.  [**Standardization** and
    **integration**](https://brunobrr.github.io/bdc/articles/00_integrate_datasets.html)
    of different datasets;
2.  [**Pre-filter**](https://brunobrr.github.io/bdc/articles/01_â˜ºprefilter.html):
    flagging and removal of invalid or non-interpretable information,
    followed by data amendments (e.g., correct transposed coordinates
    and standardize country names);
3.  [**Taxonomy**](https://brunobrr.github.io/bdc/articles/02_taxonomy.html):
    cleaning, parsing, and standardization of scientific names against
    multiple taxonomic references. The workflow corrects spelling errors
    and converts nomenclatural synonyms to currently accepted names;
4.  [**Space**](https://brunobrr.github.io/bdc/articles/03_space.html):
    flagging of erroneous, suspicious, and low-precision geographic
    coordinates;
5.  [**Time**](https://brunobrr.github.io/bdc/articles/04_time.html):
    flagging and, whenever possible, correction of inconsistent
    collection date.

Aim to facilitate the **documentation, visualization, and
interpretation** of results of data quality tests the package contains
functions for documenting the results of the data-cleaning tests,
including functions for saving i) records needing further inspection,
ii) databases containing the results of each step, iii) figures, and iv)
data-quality reports.

The modules illustrated, and functions within, can be linked to form a
workflow (see [vignettes](https://brunobrr.github.io/bdc/)), but can
also be executed independently depending on user needs.

### Installation

You can install the released version of *bdc* from
[github](https://github.com/brunobrr/bdc) with:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("brunobrr/bdc")
```

And load the package with:

``` r
library(bdc)
```

### Package website

See *bdc* package website (<https://brunobrr.github.io/bdc/>) for
detailed explanation on each step of the workflow.
