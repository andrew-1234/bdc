## Installation

You can install the released version of misc from [github](https://github.com/brunobrr/bdc) with:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
if (!require("bdc")) remotes::install_github("brunobrr/bdc")
```

### Why BDC?

Handle biodiversity data from several different sources is not an easy task. This workflow was created to facilitate i) standardization and integration of heterogeneous datasets; and ii) to flag, document, clean, and correct biodiversity data.

The workflow is composed of five main steps:

1\) **Standardization** and **integration** of different datasets;  
2) **Pre-filter**: flagging and removal of invalid or non-interpretable information, followed by data amendments (e.g., correct transposed coordinates and standardize country names);  
3) **Taxonomy**: cleaning, parsing, and standardization of scientific names against multiple taxonomic references. The workflow corrects spelling errors and converts nomenclatural synonyms to currently accepted names;  
4) **Space**: flagging of erroneous, suspicious, and low-precision geographic coordinates;  
5) **Time**: flagging and, whenever possible, correction of inconsistent collection date.

Aim to facilitate the interpretation and visualization of results, in each step of the workflow a report and figures are created. Further, standardized databases resulting from each step of the workflow as well as databases containing information needing further inspection are automatically saved.

### Package website

See BDC package website (<https://brunobrr.github.io/bdc/>) for detailed explanation on each step of the workflow.
