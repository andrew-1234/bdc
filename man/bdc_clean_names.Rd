\title{Clean and parse scientific names}
\usage{
bdc_clean_names(sci_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{sci_names}{character string. Containing scientific names.}
}
\value{
A five-column data.frame including 'scientificName' (original names
supplied), '.uncer_terms' (indicates the presence of taxonomic uncertainty
terms), '.infraesp_names' (indicates the presence of infraspecific terms),
'name_clean' (scientific names resulting from the cleaning and parsing
processes), and 'quality (an index indicating the quality of parsing
process. It ranges from 0 to 4, being 1 no problem detected, 4 serious
problems detected; a value of 0 indicates no interpretable name that was
not parsed). Also, data.frame containing all tests of the cleaning names
process and the results of the parsing names process is saved in
"Output/Check/02_parse_names.csv".
}
\description{
This functions is composed of a series of name-checking routines for cleaning
and parsing scientific names. This tools is used to remove 1) family names of animals or
plants pre-pended to species names, 2) qualifiers denoting uncertain or
provisional status of taxonomic identification (e.g., confer, species,
affinis), and 3) infraspecific terms (e.g., variety \link{var.},
subspecies \link{subsp}, forma \link{f.}, and their spelling variations). It also
includes applications to: 4) standardize names, i.e., capitalize only the first letter of
the genus name and remove extra whitespaces), and 5) parse names, i.e.,
separate author, date, annotations from taxon name.

\details{
Terms denoting uncertainty or provisional status of taxonomic
identification as well as infraspecific terms were obtained from Sigoviniet
al. (2016; doi: 10.1111/2041-210X.12594). More details about the names
parse process can be found in
